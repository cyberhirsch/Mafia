## üïπÔ∏è How to Play / Setup

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mafia-c64-browser.git
    cd mafia-c64-browser
    ```
    Alternatively, download the ZIP of this repository and extract it.

2.  **Font Setup (Crucial for Authentic Look):**
    *   This game relies on a C64 pixel font. The recommended font is **"C64 Pro Mono" by Style-7**.
    *   Download the font (e.g., from [DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/c64-pro.font) or similar font sites - search for "C64 Pro Mono").
    *   Create a folder named `fonts` in the project's root directory (if it doesn't already exist).
    *   Place the font file (e.g., `C64_Pro_Mono-STYLE.ttf`) inside this `fonts` folder.
    *   *The `style.css` file is pre-configured to look for `fonts/C64_Pro_Mono-STYLE.ttf`. If your font file has a different name or you place it elsewhere, please update the `@font-face` rule in `style.css` accordingly.*

3.  **Open in Browser:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

4.  **Gameplay:**
    *   The game will start automatically.
    *   Follow the on-screen prompts. Player 1 ("Faddie") starts the game. Turns alternate between the two players.
    *   Use your keyboard to enter choices (numbers or 'N') and press `Enter`.
    *   For screens like the Title, Status, Jail, or Game Over, pressing almost any key will advance the game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3** (utilizing CSS Variables for theming, layout, and responsive scaling calculations)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** (no external game frameworks or rendering libraries)

## üîÆ Future Development (Potential Ideas)

*   Fully implement "Aktionen" (Kidnapping, Assassination, Demolition) with proper targeting and mechanics.
*   Expand player support beyond 2 hardcoded players (e.g., selectable number of players).
*   Introduce AI opponents for a single-player mode.
*   Implement a save/load game feature (e.g., using LocalStorage or IndexedDB).
*   Further refine game balance and introduce a wider variety of random events.
*   Add authentic C64-style sound effects (e.g., using Web Audio API for beeps and simple tunes).
*   Enhance UI for selecting targets in multi-player scenarios for actions/thefts.
